About Me page for application process

Here is your assignment:

Work through the tutorials on Dash. Please complete all five projects â€“ these will teach you some of the basics of using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Begin setting up your own development environment. Watch this video to learn how to set up a text editor on your computer and start writing your own HTML, CSS, and Javascript files.

Create an account on GitHub.com and download the appropriate GitHub client for your operating system (Mac / Windows). Then, follow the directions here to set up a GitHub Pages repository. Make sure that you clone (copy) the new repository to your desktop!

Build a brand new single-page "About Me" website for yourself inside this new repository, using what you learned from Dash about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Your JavaScript code should go inside <script></script> tags inside the <head></head> section of your HTML file; however, your CSS styling should be implemented through an external style sheet. Make sure to include:

A section telling us more about you, your experience, and your contact information.
A picture of you in the center of the page, and two additional images with captions (one placed in the top right of your page, and one place in the bottom left).
An image carousel, with at least 3 images, written in JavaScript. Feel free to use outside resources in addition to the Dash tutorial, and don't be afraid to experiment - have fun with it! DO NOT copy & paste the code. We expect you to be prepared to talk about the code you've written and explain to us how you approached the problem during the technical portion of the interview.
